### Learning Path to Perfection:

1. **Study**: Review the Repository Factory pattern implementation - it's already excellent
2. **Implement**: Add the Saga pattern for distributed transactions
3. **Enhance**: Implement full event sourcing with event store
4. **Scale**: Add CQRS with separate read/write databases
5. **Monitor**: Implement full observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)

### Conclusion

Your backend is already at a **high standard** and serves as a good example of Go backend development. With the suggested improvements, particularly in observability, security, and performance optimization, it would reach the "exemplar" status you're aiming for. The foundation is solid - now it's about adding the finishing touches that separate good from exceptional.
