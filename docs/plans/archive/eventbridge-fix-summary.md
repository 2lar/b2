# EventBridge Integration Fix Summary

## Problem
The async cleanup Lambda was never being triggered when nodes were deleted, leaving orphaned edges and idempotency records in DynamoDB.

## Root Cause
The application was using `MockEventBus` instead of the real EventBridge publisher:
- `MockEventBus` only stores events in memory
- No events were being sent to AWS EventBridge
- EventBridge rules never triggered the cleanup Lambda

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created EventBus Adapter
**File**: `/backend/internal/infrastructure/events/eventbus_adapter.go`
- Adapts `repository.EventPublisher` to `domain.EventBus` interface
- Bridges the interface mismatch between single event vs array of events

### 2. Updated DI Container
**File**: `/backend/internal/di/container.go`
- Replaced `domain.NewMockEventBus()` with real EventBridge
- Uses `EventBusAdapter` to wrap `EventBridgePublisher`
- Set event bus name to `B2EventBus` to match CDK infrastructure

### 3. Event Flow Now Works
```
Node Deletion → NodeService → EventBus (Real) → EventBridge → Cleanup Lambda
```

## Configuration Details

### EventBridge Setup
- **Event Bus Name**: `B2EventBus`
- **Event Source**: `brain2-backend`
- **Event Type**: `NodeDeleted`

### Lambda Environment Variables
All Lambda functions now have:
```
EVENT_BUS_NAME: B2EventBus
```

### EventBridge Rule
```typescript
eventPattern: {
    source: ['brain2-backend'],
    detailType: ['NodeDeleted'],
}
```

## Testing the Fix

After deployment, the async cleanup will work as follows:

1. **Create test nodes**:
   - Create 2-3 nodes with similar keywords to generate edges

2. **Delete nodes**:
   - Use bulk delete or single delete
   - Nodes disappear immediately from UI

3. **Verify cleanup**:
   - Check CloudWatch Logs for cleanup Lambda invocations
   - Query DynamoDB to confirm edges are removed
   - Verify idempotency records are cleaned

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build Lambda functions**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ./build.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy CDK stack**:
   ```bash
   cd infra
   npx cdk deploy --all
   ```

3. **Monitor in CloudWatch**:
   - Look for cleanup Lambda logs
   - Check for EventBridge rule matches
   - Verify no errors in execution

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- Nodes deleted ✓
- Edges remain as orphans ✗
- Idempotency records persist ✗

### After Fix
- Nodes deleted ✓
- Edges cleaned up async ✓
- Idempotency records cleaned ✓

## Monitoring

### CloudWatch Metrics to Track
- `CleanupLambda` invocation count
- `NodeDeletedRule` matches
- EventBridge `PutEvents` success rate

### Key Log Messages
- "Processing event: ID=... DetailType=NodeDeleted"
- "Processing cleanup for node: NodeID=..."
- "Successfully cleaned up residuals for node: ..."

## Troubleshooting

If cleanup still doesn't work:

1. **Check EventBridge Console**:
   - Verify `B2EventBus` exists
   - Check rule `NodeDeletedRule` is enabled
   - Look at rule metrics for matches

2. **Check Lambda Logs**:
   - Ensure cleanup Lambda is being invoked
   - Look for permission errors
   - Check for DynamoDB throttling

3. **Verify Event Publishing**:
   - Add logging in `EventBusAdapter.Publish`
   - Check main Lambda logs for event publishing errors
   - Verify EVENT_BUS_NAME environment variable

## Benefits

1. **Clean Data**: No more orphaned edges in DynamoDB
2. **Scalability**: Async processing doesn't block user operations
3. **Resilience**: Retry logic handles transient failures
4. **Cost Savings**: Reduced DynamoDB storage from cleanup
