current state of adapters/bridges/translators in the backend:

  Remaining Adapters/Bridges:

  1. Bridge files still exist but NOT used:
    - /internal/infrastructure/persistence/bridges/ directory contains:
        - category_reader_bridge.go
      - edge_reader_bridge.go
      - node_reader_bridge.go
    - These are NOT being instantiated or used anywhere in the DI container
  2. MemoryServiceAdapter is still active:
    - Located at /internal/di/memory_service_adapter.go
    - Still being used in the container to adapt CQRS services to the legacy MemoryService interface
    - This allows gradual migration from legacy code
  3. Removed successfully:
    - All adapter files from /internal/application/adapters/ - DELETED ✓
    - All adapter files from /internal/infrastructure/persistence/adapters/ - DELETED ✓
    - Reader adapters from /internal/di/reader_adapters.go - DELETED ✓
    - Repository bridges from /internal/di/repository_bridges.go - DELETED ✓

  Summary:

  The backend is mostly free of adapters/bridges. The main components use direct CQRS repositories:
  - NodeRepository - direct DynamoDB implementation
  - EdgeRepositoryCQRS - direct DynamoDB implementation
  - CategoryRepositoryCQRS - direct DynamoDB implementation

  The only remaining adapter is the MemoryServiceAdapter which provides backward compatibility during migration. The bridge files in /persistence/bridges/ exist but are orphaned code that's
  not being used.

  To fully clean up, you could:
  1. Remove the unused bridge files in /internal/infrastructure/persistence/bridges/
  2. Eventually remove MemoryServiceAdapter once all legacy code is migrated to use CQRS services directly
