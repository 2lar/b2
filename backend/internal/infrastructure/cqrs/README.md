# CQRS Repository Implementations

This package provides the Command/Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) implementations for the repository pattern.

## Architecture Decision

The CQRS pattern separates read and write operations:
- **Readers**: Optimized for queries, can use caching, read replicas, and denormalized views
- **Writers**: Focused on consistency, transactions, and domain invariants

## Current Status

The implementation faces several architectural challenges:

1. **Interface Mismatch**: The `NodeReader`, `EdgeReader`, and `CategoryReader` interfaces in `read_write_separation.go` don't align with the existing `NodeRepository`, `EdgeRepository`, and `CategoryRepository` interfaces
2. **Type Inconsistencies**: Some interfaces expect value slices (`[]domain.Category`) while others use pointer slices (`[]*domain.Category`)
3. **Missing Methods**: The existing repositories don't implement all methods required by the CQRS interfaces
4. **Query Structure**: The query types (`NodeQuery`, `EdgeQuery`, etc.) lack fields expected by the CQRS implementations

## Solution Approach

Instead of creating adapter layers with workarounds, we should:

1. **Define Clear Contracts**: Create repository interfaces that match our actual needs
2. **Implement Properly**: Build implementations that fulfill these contracts without shortcuts
3. **Use Composition**: Leverage composition to reuse existing repository functionality where appropriate
4. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure type consistency across all layers

## Implementation Strategy

1. Create base CQRS implementations that wrap existing repositories
2. Add missing functionality through extension methods
3. Handle type conversions at the boundary, not throughout the code
4. Provide clear error messages for unimplemented features

This approach ensures clean architecture without bandaid fixes.
