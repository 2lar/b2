 * memory nodes and their relationships for a specific user. It demonstrates
 * graph data structures, network analysis concepts, and knowledge graph
 * architecture patterns.
 * 
 * üèóÔ∏è KEY GRAPH DATA STRUCTURE CONCEPTS:
 * 
 * 1. GRAPH COMPOSITION:
 *    - Vertices (nodes) represent entities or concepts
 *    - Edges represent relationships between entities
 *    - Complete graph structure enables network analysis
 *    - Foundation for knowledge discovery algorithms
 * 
 * 2. KNOWLEDGE GRAPH ARCHITECTURE:
 *    - Personal knowledge networks for individual users
 *    - Semantic relationships between memories and ideas
 *    - Dynamic graph evolution as memories are added/modified
 *    - Support for graph visualization and exploration
 * 
 * 3. NETWORK ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES:
 *    - Topology analysis (connected components, clusters)
 *    - Path analysis (shortest paths, connectivity)
 *    - Centrality analysis (most important/connected nodes)
 *    - Community detection (related memory clusters)
 * 
 * üîó GRAPH THEORY APPLICATIONS:
 * 
 * TRAVERSAL ALGORITHMS:
 * - Breadth-first search for related memory discovery
 * - Depth-first search for deep relationship exploration
 * - Graph coloring for categorization
 * - Shortest path for connection analysis
 * 
 * NETWORK METRICS:
 * - Node degree (connection count per memory)
 * - Graph density (connectivity ratio)
 * - Clustering coefficient (local connectivity)
 * - Path length distribution (relationship distances)
 * 
 * VISUALIZATION SUPPORT:
 * - Force-directed layout algorithms
 * - Hierarchical organization
 * - Interactive exploration interfaces
 * - Real-time graph updates
 * 
 * üéØ LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
 * - Graph data structure implementation
 * - Knowledge graph architecture
 * - Network analysis fundamentals
 * - Graph visualization principles

/**
 * =============================================================================
 * Graph Entity - Complete User Knowledge Network
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * DOMAIN CONCEPT:
 * A Graph represents the complete knowledge network for a single user,
 * containing all their memories (nodes) and the relationships between them
 * (edges). It serves as the top-level aggregate for knowledge graph operations.
 * 
 * AGGREGATE CHARACTERISTICS:
 * 
 * 1. DOMAIN AGGREGATE ROOT:
 *    - Encapsulates the complete knowledge graph for a user
 *    - Maintains consistency between nodes and edges
 *    - Provides operations that work on the entire graph
 *    - Ensures referential integrity of relationships
 * 
 * 2. GRAPH COMPLETENESS:
 *    - Contains all nodes (memories) for visualization
 *    - Contains all edges (relationships) for connectivity
 *    - Represents the full state of user's knowledge network
 *    - Enables comprehensive graph analysis operations
 * 
 * 3. EFFICIENT SERIALIZATION:
 *    - JSON-serializable for API responses
 *    - Compatible with graph visualization libraries
 *    - Optimized for frontend consumption
 *    - Supports real-time graph updates
 * 
 * GRAPH OPERATIONS SUPPORTED:
 * - Complete graph retrieval for visualization
 * - Subgraph extraction for focused views
 * - Graph metrics calculation
 * - Network analysis algorithms
 * - Export for external graph tools
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
 * - Memory usage scales with graph size
 * - Consider pagination for very large graphs
 * - Efficient serialization for API responses
 * - Caching strategies for frequently accessed graphs
 * 
 * FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
 * - Graph metadata (creation date, statistics)
 * - Subgraph views and filtering
 * - Graph versioning and history
 * - Graph merge and import capabilities
 * - Advanced graph metrics and analytics
