Overall Verdict

  - Strong, modern foundation with feature-sliced structure, typed API layer, React Query, CSS Modules, and sensible Vite config. It is close to “industry-level,” but a few gaps (tests, cleanup in long‑lived components, and doc mismatches) should be addressed to
  make it exemplary and broadly teachable.

  What’s Strong

  - Architecture & structure
      - Feature-based folders with colocated api/, components/, hooks/, types/ under each domain feature; clear app/, common/, services/, stores/, styles/ directories.
      - Barrel exports to keep imports clean and explicit.
  - Typed integration layer
      - OpenAPI-generated types wired through a centralized API client (clear, typed responses, retry/backoff, auth handling).
      - Clean Supabase auth client with thoughtful token-refresh/backoff handling.
  - State & data fetching
      - TanStack Query for server state with solid default retry/stale/gc configuration; good infinite pagination and typed hooks.
      - Lightweight layoutStore for client layout flags separated from domain concerns.
  - Styling & accessibility
      - CSS Modules for component scoping; global tokens in styles/base.css with dark/light theme via data-theme.
      - Semantics and a11y touches: skip link, role/aria in LoadingScreen and Header, keyboard-friendly controls.
  - Build & DX
      - Vite root under src/ with envDir pointing to repo root; manual chunking and aliases; source maps on; sensible dev scripts (typecheck, lint/format, tests).
      - Real-time WS client offers both simple and “optimized” variants with batching/reconnect/metrics.

  Gaps to Address

  - Long‑lived intervals and potential memory leaks
      - Unscoped setInterval calls without cleanup in graph view:
          - frontend/src/features/memories/components/GraphVisualization.tsx:296
          - frontend/src/features/memories/components/GraphVisualization.tsx:743
          - frontend/src/features/memories/components/GraphVisualization.tsx:761
      - These should live in useEffect with cleanup or store timer IDs and clear them on unmount.
  - Test coverage and consistency
      - Vitest is configured but unit tests are sparse (only NotificationBanner); add tests for hooks (useMemoriesFeed, useNodesQuery) and services (apiClient, authClient).
      - You import @testing-library/jest-dom in setup but use react-test-renderer in the sample test. If sticking with Testing Library for component tests, add @testing-library/react and use it consistently.
  - Documentation mismatches
      - Script instructions are out of date: frontend/README.md:36-39 still describes npm run test as TypeScript-only; package.json runs Vitest.
      - Tech stack note mentions Zustand for “long-lived graph state” which was removed; update those lines for accuracy.
  - Redundant/fragile runtime assets
      - frontend/src/index.html:7 includes a CDN cytoscape script while the app already imports cytoscape from npm. This risks double-loading/version skew; remove the CDN script.
  - Performance and accessibility polish
      - Graph physics set to “infinite” with periodic animations could consume CPU on low-end devices; consider pausing for inactive tabs and respecting prefers-reduced-motion.
      - Add a global visible focus style and confirm color contrast across dark/light tokens.
  - Minor DX nits
      - vite.config.ts has console logging of envs during startup; consider silencing or gating behind mode === 'development'.
      - Align imports to consistently use the services barrel vs direct file paths where possible.

  Teachability

  - This repo is a strong teaching vehicle: it demonstrates feature-sliced organization, typed adapters, react-query patterns, scoped CSS, auth+API separation, and a realistic real-time client. Once the graph cleanup, tests, and docs alignment land, it can serve
  as a reference-quality starter for frontend best practices. The docs/ content (QA checklist and review notes) is a great start—commit it and extend with short “playbooks” for common tasks (adding a feature, writing a query hook, creating a component with CSS
  Modules and a test).

  Actionable Next Steps

  - Fix graph lifecycle issues
      - Wrap the intervals and the viewport watchdog in useEffect with cleanup in frontend/src/features/memories/components/GraphVisualization.tsx:296, :743, :761.
      - Consider pausing animations on document.visibilitychange and honoring prefers-reduced-motion.
  - Remove duplicated Cytoscape load
      - Delete the external script in frontend/src/index.html:7; rely solely on npm-imported cytoscape.
  - Align docs with code
      - Update frontend/README.md:36-39 to describe Vitest and include lint, format, typecheck commands.
      - Adjust the stack notes about Zustand now that graphStore is gone.
  - Grow test coverage
      - Add Testing Library and cover:
          - useMemoriesFeed, useNodesQuery (pagination, errors, retries).
          - apiClient (auth failures, retries, mapping transforms).
          - Components with behavior: MemoryList (editing/deleting), GraphControls.
      - Add a minimal E2E smoke via Cypress later (auth happy-path, create/edit/delete memory, view in graph).
  - A11y/UX refinements
      - Global focus ring tokens; validate contrast in both themes.
      - Announce dynamic updates (e.g., memory count changes) via a live region if relevant.
  - Commit helpful docs
      - Add frontend/docs/ to version control and extend with:
          - “How to add a new feature slice”
          - “How to write a data hook”
          - “How to style with CSS Modules”
          - “Testing patterns (components, hooks, services)”
