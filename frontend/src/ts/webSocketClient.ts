/**
 * =============================================================================
 * WebSocket Client - Real-Time Communication for Graph Updates
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * üìö EDUCATIONAL OVERVIEW:
 * This module implements real-time bidirectional communication between the frontend
 * and backend using WebSockets. It enables instant graph updates without requiring
 * users to refresh the page, creating a responsive and collaborative experience.
 * 
 * üèóÔ∏è KEY ARCHITECTURAL CONCEPTS:
 * 
 * 1. REAL-TIME ARCHITECTURE:
 *    - WebSocket protocol for persistent, bidirectional connections
 *    - Event-driven updates for immediate UI synchronization
 *    - Pushes server-side changes to all connected clients
 *    - Enables collaborative features and live updates
 * 
 * 2. CONNECTION RESILIENCE:
 *    - Automatic reconnection on connection loss
 *    - Exponential backoff and retry strategies
 *    - Graceful handling of network interruptions
 *    - State preservation across reconnections
 * 
 * 3. AUTHENTICATION INTEGRATION:
 *    - JWT token-based WebSocket authentication
 *    - Secure connection establishment
 *    - User-specific message routing
 *    - Session management and token refresh
 * 
 * 4. EVENT-DRIVEN COMMUNICATION:
 *    - Custom DOM events for loose coupling
 *    - Publisher-subscriber pattern for scalability
 *    - Type-safe message handling
 *    - Flexible event routing and processing
 * 
 * 5. ERROR HANDLING AND MONITORING:
 *    - Comprehensive connection state tracking
 *    - Detailed error logging for debugging
 *    - Graceful degradation when connections fail
 *    - User feedback for connection status
 * 
 * üì° WEBSOCKET WORKFLOW:
 * 1. Client authenticates and gets JWT token
 * 2. WebSocket connection established with token in URL
 * 3. Server validates token and establishes user session
 * 4. Real-time message exchange begins
 * 5. Automatic reconnection if connection drops
 * 
 * üîÑ REAL-TIME UPDATE FLOW:
 * 1. User creates/updates/deletes memory via HTTP API
 * 2. Backend processes request and updates database
 * 3. Backend sends WebSocket message to all user's connections
 * 4. Frontend receives message and dispatches DOM event
 * 5. Graph visualization updates automatically
 * 
 * üéØ LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
 * - WebSocket protocol and real-time communication
 * - Connection management and resilience patterns
 * - Event-driven architecture in the browser
 * - Authentication for persistent connections
 * - Error handling for network communications
 * - Browser event system integration

 * Global WebSocket State Management

 * STATE VARIABLES:

 * - reconnectTimer: Timer ID for automatic reconnection attempts
 * - WEBSOCKET_URL: Environment-configured WebSocket endpoint

 * DESIGN PATTERN:
 * Module singleton pattern provides a single WebSocket connection

 * WebSocket Connection Establishment
 * 
 * This function manages the complete WebSocket connection lifecycle, from
 * authentication through connection establishment to event handler setup.
 * It demonstrates several important real-time communication patterns.
 * 
 * CONNECTION WORKFLOW:
 * 1. Validate existing connection state
 * 2. Verify configuration and authentication
 * 3. Establish WebSocket connection with authentication
 * 4. Set up comprehensive event handlers
 * 5. Handle connection state changes and errors
 * 
 * AUTHENTICATION STRATEGY:
 * - JWT token passed as URL parameter for WebSocket auth
 * - Server validates token before accepting connection
 * - Token refresh handled by auth client integration
 * - Secure connection establishment process
 * 
 * RESILIENCE PATTERNS:
 * - Duplicate connection prevention
 * - Configuration validation before connection attempts
 * - Automatic reconnection on failures
 * - Comprehensive error handling and logging
 * 
 * EVENT-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE:
 * - DOM custom events for loose coupling between modules
 * - Type-safe message parsing and handling
 * - Extensible message routing for future message types
 * - Error boundaries to prevent message processing failures

     *

     * If no token is available, the user isn't authenticated and
     * WebSocket connection should not be attempted.

     * to respond to the same real-time updates independently.

     * CURRENT MESSAGE TYPES:
     * - graphUpdated: Indicates the user's knowledge graph has changed
     *   and visualization should refresh to show latest data

     * - nodeCreated: Real-time node creation notifications
     * - nodeUpdated: Real-time node modification notifications  
     * - nodeDeleted: Real-time node deletion notifications

     * 
     * AUTOMATIC RECONNECTION:
     * Implement resilient connection management by automatically attempting
     * to reconnect after connection loss. This ensures users don't lose
     * real-time functionality due to temporary network issues.
     * 
     * RECONNECTION STRATEGY:

     * - 1000: Normal closure (user logout, page refresh)
     * - 1001: Going away (page navigation)
     * - 1006: Abnormal closure (network issue)
     * - 4000+: Application-specific codes (auth failure, etc.)

     * which will initiate the automatic reconnection process.
     * This ensures errors don't leave connections in undefined states.
     * 
     * ERROR LOGGING:
     * Comprehensive error logging helps with debugging connection issues
     * in development and monitoring connection health in production.

 *

 * 1. Cancel any pending reconnection attempts
 * 2. Close active WebSocket connection with proper close code
 * 3. Clear connection references to prevent memory leaks
 * 4. Prevent automatic reconnection after intentional disconnect
 * 
 * RESOURCE CLEANUP:
 * - Clear reconnection timers to prevent unnecessary background processes
 * - Set socket reference to null for garbage collection
 * - Use standard close code (1000) to indicate normal closure
 * - Provide descriptive close reason for server-side logging
 * 
 * USAGE SCENARIOS:
 * - User logout: Prevent real-time updates for logged-out users
 * - Page navigation: Clean up connections before leaving the app
 * - Connection management: Manually disconnect for troubleshooting
 * - Resource optimization: Close connections during idle periods
 * 
 * WEBSOCKET CLOSE CODES:
 * - 1000: Normal closure (recommended for user-initiated disconnects)
 * - 1001: Going away (page navigation, browser close)
 * - 1002: Protocol error (unexpected server response)
 * - 1003: Unsupported data (server can't process message type)

 * =============================================================================
 * WebSocket Client Public API Export
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * PUBLIC INTERFACE:
 * This export provides a clean, documented API for WebSocket operations
 * while encapsulating internal state and implementation details.
 * 
 * API DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
 * - Simple function-based interface for ease of use
 * - Clear separation between connection and disconnection
 * - Internal state management hidden from consumers
 * - Consistent naming with other client modules
 * 
 * USAGE PATTERNS:
 * ```typescript

 * // Establish real-time connection after user login
 * await webSocketClient.connect();
 * 
 * // Clean up connection on logout
 * webSocketClient.disconnect();
 * ```
 * 
 * INTEGRATION POINTS:
 * - Auth client: Called after successful authentication
 * - App controller: Integrated into login/logout workflows
 * - Graph visualization: Listens for 'graph-update-event' DOM events
 * - Error handling: Provides connection status feedback
 * 
 * FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
 * - Connection status monitoring
 * - Message sending capabilities
 * - Subscription management for specific event types
 * - Connection health metrics and reporting
 * - Configurable reconnection strategies
